👋 Hi, I’m @mayife
👀 I’m interested in photovoltaic power forecasting, machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and renewable energy technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning geography with a focus on remote sensing and spatial data analysis, and applying deep learning algorithms for energy forecasting.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to photovoltaic/wind power forecasting, multimodal data fusion, or machine learning model development.
